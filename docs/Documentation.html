<p>The documentation for Macomber Map is ongoing - I have a goal of adding a page a day starting in 2014, so please be patient as the documentation comes online. I'll first focus on the user interface components, then move to the architecture and the ways new
 data can be visualized and integrated into the map.</p>
<p>A very old (circa 2009) &quot;cheat sheet&quot; PDF is available in the root of the source code, to describe some of the ways one can interact with the application.</p>
